<h1>IT Assignment 1</h1>
<h2>Personal Information</h2>

<p>I’m a 20 year old Australian, I went to high school in Bacchus Marsh where I lived all my life until this year when I moved to St Leonards. <br>I started university at RMIT city campus in 2018 studying a Bachelor of Science then began doing my studies online just before the pandemic started. <br>This class is one of the final 2 classes I have before completing my degree. 
<br>A hobby of mine is playing piano and reading horror books, my favourite author is Stephen King.
</p>
 
<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
<p>I am doing a Bachelor of Science and have chosen this introduction to IT class as an elective. Probably a silly reason to be interested in IT but one of my favourite tv shows is Mr Robot which is about a group of hackers. This show made me realise how much of the world operates and relies on technology to run things such as the economy and how easily your personal information can be stolen online. I have not had much IT experience except using basic things on a computer like the internet and excel.</p>

<p>I choose to come it RMIT because it was easily accessible by train from where I lived and I wanted to further my education in science. I choose to major in biological science because ai find it interesting and I think there is more jobs in that field than my other choice physics.</p>

<p>In this degree I expected to learn all the structures and functions of living organisms, the chemistry of biological systems and how to work professionally in a lab. 
</p>

<h2>Ideal Job</h2>

<p>This job position is for an optometrist. Optometrists are healthcare specialists that examine eyes for vision problems and ocular diseases. I have glasses and have been to the optometrist many times. <br>I have always thought it was interesting looking at picture of the back of my eye and updating my prescription so I could see better. I know how important it is to be able to see properly and I would like to give that to other people by being an optometrist. </p>
<p>To become an optometrist in Australia you have to do a Bachelor of Science or Biomedical Science. Then complete a 4 year Doctor of Optometry degree. I have nearly completed a Bachelor of Science then will hopefully go on to do the Doctor of Optometry degree. Skills required to be an optometrist would include being able to perform thorough eye and vision exams then analyse the results, diagnose, and treat ocular problems and diseases such as near-sightedness and glaucoma, prescribe corrective lenses and fit contact lenses and handle eyecare emergencies. <br> Skills that would also be necessary are communication skills, time management skills, attention to detail and people skills.

<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
<h3>Personality test- Myers-Briggs test</h3>
<a href="https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality#:~:text=An%20Architect%20(INTJ)%20is%20a,often%20a%20private%2C%20complex%20one.">Test Results Link</a>
<p>Architect personality INTJ-A / INTJ-T</p>
<p>This test suggests that the strengths of people with an architect personality are that they are introverted, rational, independent, determined and goal-oriented. I think this test is very accurate in its description of my personality. The weaknesses are apparently being overly critical and I am sometimes. <br> Architects tend to prefer lone-wolf positions rather than working in a team. I agree, being an introvert probably makes team work more challenging so I should put extra effort into making sure I work cooperatively and contribute equally. I think the tests results are valid, they have clearly worked out the questions well to reflect what personality you have. </p>

<h3>Learning style test</h3>
<a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml?event=results&A=9&V=9&T=2">Test Results Link</a>
<p>Your Scores:
•	Auditory: 45%
•	Visual: 45%
•	Tactile: 10%
</p>

<p>The results of this test shows that I’m apparently equally an auditory and visual learner. Meaning I can understand and remember things by sight and by listening. This is useful because I'm less restricted to one form or another. This means in a team I am able to follow written or verbal instructions or discussion. </p>

<h3>Psychometric test</h3>
<a href="https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM">Test link</a>

<img src="Picture2.png" alt="test">
<p>This indicates introversion, high emotional stability, critical, careful and diligent, and intellectual. This tests shows similar results to the personality Myers-Briggs test, meaning this test is probably accurate if two different test results are close. Introversion means I’m probably less likely to initiate conversations during group work, however, I am able to get the work done on time. </p>

<h2>Project Idea</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>An IT project that I think would be useful is a smartphone application that when connected to your car while driving, all other phone apps except phone calls through the car speakers will be disabled to stop people using their phone while driving to prevent accidents. <br>This app would also show on the car display the speed limit of the road you are on and alerts you to where the stationary speed cameras or red-light cameras are. These features would potentially save people getting a fine.</p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>Phone apps being disabled would prevent people from using their phones while driving. This would prevent many car accidents. Studies in America and the UK have reported mobile phone distraction to cause one in four car accidents. <br>In Australia, 46% of ‘near crashes’, 22% of car accident and 71% of truck accidents have been caused by drivers using their mobile devices. Experts say using a mobile phone while driving significantly impacts your ability to focus.
<br>This app would also save many people from getting fines when it is not necessarily their fault. Many times I have been driving and have not seen a speed sign or can’t remember what it was. If the speed limit was on my cars display, I would never have to worry about accidently doing the wrong speed limit. Also being alerted to red light cameras would help you prepare for intersections.
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>When you enter the car, the phone will automatically connect to the cars display and all apps will be disabled except phone calls through the Bluetooth speakers. When driving, the speed limit of the road will be shown on car display. When approaching a speed camera or a red light camera you will be alerted by a sound and a notification on the car display.
<br>People probably wouldn’t voluntarily download this app because most people like using their phones while driving. I think this app should come already installed on the phone from the manufacturer and the software in the cars bluetooth automatically connect to the app without user control. This would prevent phone use while driving from people who have total disregard for their own and other peoples safety. 
The app would need to have access to GPS and location so it could see what road you are on. All of  the locations of the stationary speed cameras, red light cameras and the speed limit for each road programmed on it. It needs to have access to disable apps on the phone when it connects to the car.
</p>

<h3>Tools and technologies</h3>
<p>I don’t have any experience with building apps but from my research you can build iOS apps with Xcode and Swift and Android apps with Java or Kotlin.
For the maps component of the app GPS would need to be used. The car used would need a screen for display in it and bluetooth connectivity.</p>


<h3>Skills required</h3>
<p>Skills required for the mobile application developer are</P 
<p>-	Being able to develop a mobile user interface design that is easy to use and looks good. </p>
<p>-	Programming skills</p>
<p>-	Cross platform development</p>
<p>-	Back end computing such as security and database management</p>
<p>-	Business capabilities
</p>


<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>The outcome of this project would hopefully be the prevention of drivers using their phones while driving which could reduce road accidents. This app would also inform drivers of the speed limit and of any speed or red light cameras reducing fines and accidental speeding.</p>
